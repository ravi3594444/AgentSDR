/**
 * In-process replacement for external cron hitting /api/outreach/tick.
 * Safe ONLY because this app always runs as a single long-lived instance
 * (confirmed — no horizontal scaling); with more than one instance this
 * would double-tick and double-send, since nothing here claims a
 * distributed lock. If that ever changes, revert to external cron
 * per-instance or add a DB-based "only one instance runs this" claim.
 *
 * Started once from instrumentation.ts at process boot. This is only the send
 * tick (every TICK_INTERVAL_MS, default 10 seconds), with its repair (due work
 * missing from the queue topped up every few minutes). The daily queue rebuild is
 * each organization's daily rollover in src/lib/scheduler/ — at a fixed
 * wall-clock time claimed in scheduled_job_runs, not an "every 24h since
 * boot" timer (that was tried and rejected: a restart resets the clock, so
 * the rebuild time drifted with every deploy).
 *
 * Guards against overlapping tick runs and swallows/logs errors so one bad
 * tick can't kill the loop or crash the process.
